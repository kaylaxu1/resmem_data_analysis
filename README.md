Even though facial memorability is an integral part of how we interact with the world (remembering people in social media posts, school textbooks, movies, magazines, etc.), we do not have a good way of explaining why some faces are more memorable than others. In this study, we seek to explore whether the memorability of an image can be predicted based on facial attribute ratings. We correlate the 31 mean facial attribute ratings of 1004 images from the One Million Impression (OMI) dataset with the ResMem model’s predicted memorability scores, using linear regression and nonlinear Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression. We then examine the contributions of individual attributes theorized to impact memorability in previous studies and observe that they weakly correlate with ResMem memorability scores. On the other hand, the correlation of attribute ratings to the subjective “memorable” rating from the OMI dataset is observed to support the Von Restorff effect and U-shaped relationship between attractiveness and memorability.
